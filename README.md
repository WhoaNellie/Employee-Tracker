# Employee-Tracker

## Description

This is my thirteenth project for UA's coding bootcamp. It is NodeJS application that allows you to manage a database of employees, roles, and departments.

## Installation

To install this project download the repository. Then open the server.js file and put in the username and password for your mysql server. Install the necessary packages using 'npm install' and run 'node server.js' from your terminal.

If you just wish to test the project, there is a seed.sql file you may use to fill the database.

## Usage

Follow the prompts in your terminal, you will be able to view all or add employees, roles, and datbases. You may also update an emloyee's role or manager or delete employees from the database.
